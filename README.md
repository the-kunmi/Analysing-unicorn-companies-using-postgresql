# Analysing-unicorn-companies-using-postgresql


The average return from investing in stocks is 10% per year (not accounting for inflation)? But who wants to be average?!

I've been asked to support an investment firm by analyzing trends in high-growth companies. They are interested in understanding which industries are producing the highest valuations and the rate at which new high-value companies are emerging. Providing them with this information gives them a competitive insight as to industry trends and how they should structure their portfolio looking forward.
